# What is Figma

> Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool.

Which mean you can use it for designing graphical stuff and also use for prototyping works such as software, web application, mobile application, etc.

Figma helped me in web development as I can design my website as a prototype and click around to see what the user experience would be like without having to actually code it first, which reduce the time needed to rebuild something if it doesn't work out.

# Getting Started With Figma
you can go to https://www.figma.com to register for a free account. With Free account, you can create unlimited drafts and 3 figma or figjam if shared with others.

## Your first design with Figma

### Setting up new frames (artboards)
Press **A** or **F** to see all frame options in the properties panel on the right-hand side and pick the size you wish to work with or simply draw your own frame. As in Sketch, you can work at **1x** (meaning the actual pixel size) as there is no quality loss when resizing. You can still export assets any larger size you might need.

But unlike traditional artboards, you can nest frames within each other. This allows you to create more complex designs that interact with each other.
